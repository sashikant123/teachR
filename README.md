## Description <img src="reference/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

`teachR` is a package for [`R`](http://www.r-project.org) that bundles several 
[`Shiny`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web applications for educational use. 

The goal of `teachR` is to provide teachers and educators with free, easy-to-use
and interactive applications for complementing their courses with virtual 
demonstrations and/or experiments. 

The [`Shiny`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications in `teachR` can be launched 
directly from within [`R`](http://www.r-project.org) or [`RStudio`](http://www.rstudio.com). 
They can also be exported toward a local folder for later deployment 
on [`shinyapp.io`](https://www.shinyapps.io/) or on a personal 
[`Shiny Server`](http://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) instance. 

The `teachR` package is at a very early stage of development. It contains only a 
few [`Shiny`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications at the moment, but this 
number is meant to grow with the help of [`Shiny`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) 
developers looking to make their educational web applications more easily 
accessible. 

If you are a [`Shiny`](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) developer and want to 
participate, just fork this repository, add your application(s) to the "inst/apps" 
folder with a properly formatted "info" file (see other apps for examples), and 
send me a pull request.
